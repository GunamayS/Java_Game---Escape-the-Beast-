Project: 'Escape the beast' Author: Gunamay Sachdev

The name of the game is called 'Escape the beast' and the purpose of the game is to navigate through the rooms and try to find all
6 items scattered across. Each item has a weight and the player has a maximum weight limit on how much weight they can carry.
There is a magic apple hidden somewhere, which when eaten will double the weight capacity of the player. 
The player has to try and beat the game in a certain number of moves, otherwise the beast will catch up to them and they will lose the game.
